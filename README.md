# Valorant-pro-match-predicor.
This is a simple pro Valorant match predicor which uses simple classifiers to predict possible outcomes of matchups, based on past data. It's as simple as it gets, map, team_1, team_2 and Won. It has Region loc, but you just need to combine datasets to make it internatioinal.
